This project took much longer to build than I expected, but it was a great way to develop my CSS layout skills as I couldn't use the Google page source to understand how the layout was done (as it was uglified and minified) so I was forced to build out my own HTML structure for the page and write most of the CSS myself. I did use the Developer Tools in my browser ocassionaly when I got stuck.
