# Google Homepage

My attempt to recreate the Google homepage, an example Google search result and the Google 404 page.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).

You can the site live here;

[**Easy Version:**](https://google-homepage-odin-project.netlify.com) Google.com homepage.

[**Difficult Version:**](https://google-homepage-odin-project.netlify.com/search)Google.com search results page.

[**Just for fun**](https://google-homepage-odin-project.netlify.com/404.html)Google.com 404 page.


## What I learnt

This project took much longer to build than I expected, but it was a great way to develop my CSS layout skills as I couldn't use the Google page source to understand how the layout was done (as it was uglified and minified). This forced me to build out my own HTML structure for the page as well as write most of the CSS myself. I did use the Developer Tools in my browser occasionally when I got stuck.


## Tools used

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The HTML and CSS for this page was all written in
- Safari, Chrome and Firefox developer tools.
- [PixelSnap](https://getpixelsnap.com) for measuring elements and distances.
- [Sip](http://sipapp.io/) for picking colours.
- [GitHub](https://github.com) for version control.
- [Netlify](netlify.com) for hosting.
